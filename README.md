epiphone
========

An experimental whisper protocol in Rust.

Based lightly on the [Epidemic Broacast Trees](http://asc.di.fct.unl.pt/~jleitao/pdf/srds07-leitao.pdf) paper.

Testing and documentation still in progress, though stability/availability has not yet been an issue.

Beginnings of whitepaper is in LaTeX in the `doc/` folder, and API docs are Rust-generated.
